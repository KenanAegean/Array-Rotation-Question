# Array-Rotation-Question
A Interwiew Question

Have the function ArrayRotation(arr) take the arr parameter being passed whih will be an array of non-negative integers and circularly rotate the array starting from the Nth element where N is equal to the first integer in the array. For example: if arr is [2, 3, 4, 1, 6, 10] then ypur program should rotatethe array starting from the 2nd position because the first elemnt in the array is 2. The final array will therefore be [4, 1, 6, 10, 2, 3],, and your proogram should return the new array as a string , so for this example yor progam would return 4161023. The first element in the array will always be an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than size of the array.
